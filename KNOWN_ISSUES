Known Issue on Abisko, HPC2N:
    you install mpi4py, but when you run the simulation, python says it can't import it.
    fix: module add  python-pip/8.1 and follow the instructions


Fetature: If a mutation was already run earlier, it should automatically be removed, if the run is repeated

Issue #1a: Add a list of immutable residues, eg. catalytic ones, or residues that are in the first shell,
           form salt bridges, or are otherwise known to kill the enzyme activity, (eg structural reasons).
Issue #1b: If ionisation of a residue can't change, (eg catalyic residue), SCWRL4 replaces it anyways.

Issue #4: substrate (DCE) was not exactly copied but moved around

Suggestion #1: change of protonation states possibly with apbs-pdb2pqr and propka

Suggestion #2: residues that are part of a structural feature, e.g. an alpha-helix, should not be mutated to a residue
               with a big helical penalty (eg. proline >> glycine > ASP,CYS,ASN,HIS,THR,VAL)
               see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix#Table_of_standard_amino_acid_alpha-helical_propensities

BUG #3: Not possible to resolvate and delete unnec.

BUG #4: Scwrl4.ini has to be adjusted for each cluster on the fly, so that it points to the right bbrot 

RENAME: [pos] ==> hotspot-ish

FEATURE: add support for archive with qprep.inp, libraries, accepts
       & umbauen, so dass rechen-intensive schritte auf cluster-node machen (dann ist ordner oder so zwingend).

WORK WITH EVERYTHING in a temporary folder (its so much cleaner, can multitask, etc)

More documentation

FEATURE #1: MPI4PY/Ensemblaris: If simulation crashed during warmup (first ~4 steps, restart up to X times with smaller stepsizes).

FEATURE #2: MPI4PY/Ensemblaris: Remove finished simulations. If done properly, its possible to work in ramdisk;  cp.pop(KEY-NAME, None)

ISSUES WITH MPI4PY:
#1 write qfep and qcalc into qscripts's config file
